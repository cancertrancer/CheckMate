# CheckMate
A Credit Card Number Validator - creation prompted by a Codecademy challenge project!

Project completed November 18, 2020

If I've learned anything from completing this project, it's to use the .forEach() method instead of "for" loops whenever possible.

checker.js is main.js updated with 3 lines to improve readability through use of comments and to add testing.

Sharing as a big thank you to Codecademy for helping me to learn JavaScript! 

Run document in Node on the command line to see it in action.
